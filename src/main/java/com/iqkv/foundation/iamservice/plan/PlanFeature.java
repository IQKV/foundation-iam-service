/**
 * Local copy of a single named feature entry as returned by the billing service

 * <p>Intentionally a plain record — no shared library dependency on billing service.
 * The feature code is also the map key on {@link PlanEntitlement#features()}; carrying it
 * here keeps each entry self-contained for serialisation and display. Unknown JSON fields
 * are ignored by the Jackson deserializer.

 * @param code        machine-readable identifier, matches the map key
 *                    (e.g. {@code "priority_support"})
 * @param title       human-readable label
 * @param value       feature value as a string ({@code "true"}/{@code "false"} or a number)
 * @param description optional description shown on pricing pages
